@jonasLyk reported a REALLY interesting corruption error reported by NTFS:

Triggering the notification only requires that you visit a particular path on an NTFS volume.

Our research indicates that the “file corrupt” error bubbles up from a network query open, so it’s sufficient to just call GetFileAttributes to see the behavior. 
We think the bug is in all the changes around case sensitivity...There’s a memory compare of “$i30” with “$I30” before the descent into chaos. Also if you use “$I30” 
in the offending command you don’t get the problem.

The directory is not really corrupt at this point and the volume is not immediately corrupted by this change. The result is ugly though and we have anecdotal evidence of a system here at OSR failing to boot after multiple attemps to chkdsk, so we though we'd mitigate the problem while we wait for the real fix to arrive.

This filter blocks any attempts to open a stream that begins with ":$i30:". This blocks more than just the intended path (e.g. ":$i30:$index_allocation") but we believe 
the mpact of this to be minimal.
